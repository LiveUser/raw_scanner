# raw_scanner

A simplified barcode scanner.

Hecho en Puerto Rico ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· por RadamÃ©s J. ValentÃ­n Reyes

## What is this?

A package to scan barcodes(QR codes and others) in a simplified manner. It's a wrapper around libraries rather than a personal project coded from scratch.

## Why did I make this?

Simplified flutter packages for scanning QR codes that I could find didn't work, the others were too time consuming to get them  to work, so I took the best among them and tried to simplify it.

## Importing the package

~~~dart
import 'package:raw_scanner/raw_scanner.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_scanner/qr_code_scanner.dart';//Importing the original library is important for using the BarcodeFormat enum which is a required parameter
~~~

## Use

### Note: "RawScanner" is the object that contains all of the methods.



The example below returns a Widget containing a QR code

~~~dart
RawScanner.generateQrCode("A string for the QR here")
~~~



The example below scans for the specified "typeOfCode" and returns it as a String. Take into account that the returned value may be null. Remember that you have to make sure that you check that the returned value isn't null and may have to use the null check operator afterwards to prevent errors. [More about null safety  on this link][https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety] 

~~~dart
String? scanResults = await RawScanner.scanCode(
	typeOfCode: BarcodeFormat.qrcode, 
	context: context,
	foregroundColor: Colors.red,
);
~~~



## Full example

~~~dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_scanner/qr_code_scanner.dart';
import 'package:raw_scanner/raw_scanner.dart';

void main() => runApp(Runner());

class Runner extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Test(),
    );
  }
}

class Test extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TestState createState() => _TestState();
}

class _TestState extends State<Test> {
  String? scanResults = "";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: ()async{
                scanResults = await RawScanner.scanCode(
                  typeOfCode: BarcodeFormat.qrcode, 
                  context: context,
                  foregroundColor: Colors.black,
                  backgroundColor: Colors.cyan,
                );
                print(scanResults);
                if(scanResults != null){
                  setState(() {
                    scanResults = scanResults;
                  });
                }
              }, 
              child: Text(
                "Scan",
              ),
            ),
            RawScanner.generateQrCode(
              data: scanResults!,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
